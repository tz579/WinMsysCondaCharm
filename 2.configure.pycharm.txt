Notes for "demo.tts.py" script:
1. the "os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True'" line added is aiming to
   prevent the "duplicated libiomp5md.dll" error. This is an upstream conda design error for
   Windows system (no such error for Linux) and has no fundamental solutions for this yet.
2. a "plt.show()" line is added after "plt.imshow(spec[0].cpu().detach())" to actually show
   the figure, and we need to close the figure to continue running the script.
3. the ipython output relies on jupyter notebook environment which is not setup for now.
   If we need the jupyter notebook environment, the following link could be used as reference:
